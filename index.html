    <p>To start off, my name is Jackson Kelley. I began to learn HTML and CSS in October of 2018, and it has almost been a year since I started
        my web-development journey. It has been a fun journey that has helped me learn a lot about myself as a person, and about the tech world as
        a whole.</p>
