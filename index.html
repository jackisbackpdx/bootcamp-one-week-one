    <h2>Starting to Learn</h2>
    <p>To start off, my name is Jackson Kelley. I began to learn HTML and CSS in October of 2018, and it has almost been a year since I started
        my web-development journey. It has been a fun journey that has helped me learn a lot about myself as a person, and about the tech world as
        a whole.</p>
    <h2>Things I Enjoy Doing</h2>
    <p>As of lately I've been drawing more, as well as hanging out with some of my friends who share some of the same hobbies that I have. Finding rare
        items at thrift stores is something that I enjoy doing, as it also saves a lot of money. Visual arts not pertaining to only web development is 
        also a pursuit that I find fulfilling. Recently I bought a new set of oil paint so that I can improve my skills of painting with said oil paint. Some other things that
        I like to do include playing basketball, soccer, running.

    <h2>More Info About Me</h2>
    <p>I was born in Portland in the Mt. Tabor area and went to Franklin High School. This is an amazing city and I wish to live here for a long time, 
        although rent is still high here.
